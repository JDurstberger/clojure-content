![REPL Driven development and Unit testing in Clojure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/practicalli/graphic-design/live/repl-tdd-flow.png)

In Clojure the unit under test is the function.  Unit test coverage should test all public function that form the API of their respective namespace.

`clojure.test` namespace provides a unit testing framework and is included in the Clojure library, so is available in all Clojure projects.

[Test runners](/testing/test-runners/) are used to run one or more tests in a project.


## Simple principles for writing unit tests
* One `test` namespace for each `src` namespace
* One `deftest` function for each function under test
* Multiple `is` assertions for one function
* Group assertions in `testing` and provide a meaningful description of that grouping, adding more information when reviewing test failures especially for larger code bases.
* `are` for testing similar functionality with different data sets
* Test private functions (or don't use them) through public functions of each namespace (minimize test churn and time to run all tests)
* Use [generative testing](/clojure-spec/) to create less code and yet test with more extensive range of data
* Use [test selectors](test-selectors.md) to organize tests and optimize speed of test runs


## Project structure with tests
By convention, separate `src` and `test` directories are used to hold the source code and the code that tests that source code.

For each source code file in `src` there should be a corresponding file in test with the same name and `_test` postfix.

For example, code to test the `src/codewars/rock_paper_scissors.clj` is saved in the file `src/codewars/rock_paper_scissors_test.clj` file.

## Source and Test Namespaces
As with file names, the namespaces for each test code file is the same as the source code it is testing, with a `-test` postfix.

`codewars/rock-paper-scissors` source code namespace will have a matching `codewars/rock-paper-scissors-test` namespace.

> #### Hint::Create Projects from templates
> Templates typically include a parallel `test` and `src` directory structure.  The `clj-new` tool has build it templates (app, lib) and will create `src` and `test` directories in the projects it creates.

<!-- TODO: clj-new - does this add a test namespace if you add a src namesspace to an existing project? -->
